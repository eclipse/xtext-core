This source folder only contains a link to the "org" directory, which contains
Xtext.ecore and Xtext.genmodel.

This way, the two files will be copied in the output folder, and the tests
in org.eclipse.xtext.extras will find Xtext.ecore with the URI
"classpath:/org/eclipse/xtext/Xtext.ecore".

This is required to run the tests from Eclipse, in particular when "org.eclipse.xtext"
is imported as a project in the workbench.
