 * Allows a language to execute side-effects when the URI of a resource changes.

 * user in a file browser. An example for a language in which such side-effects
 * would make sense is Java, where the package name and the name of the first
 * public top-level class must match the resource's path.
 * 
 * Clients usually call {@link ResourceRelocationContext#addModification} to
 * register their side effects. This way it is ensured that the resource is
 * properly loaded and watched for changes.
 * 
 * In Eclipse, {@link IResourceRelocationStrategy} are registered to an extension
 * point.
